 Tiny bit of talk prep. 
=========================================
In preparation for this talk I sent a copy of the email below to the
 AAS
 RAS
 STFC
 IOP

I also tweeted at the IAU, since I couldn't find the relevant contact details
there. 


Subject: Request for latest <organisation> statistics for career development of Physics/Astrophysics PhDs

Dear <Organisation>, 

By way of introduction, I am currently an STFC Ernest Rutherford Fellow at the
University of Edinburgh. I am also a current member of the RAS and AAS. 

I’m due to present a short talk at the Institute for Astronomy this week regarding 
"The culture of research and the future of the science system”, which is also the title 
of a conference I’m attending at the Royal Society next week. 

I would be *extremely* interested to have to hand the very latest figures from the 
<Organisation> regarding astronomy/astrophysics career progression. In particular, I’d be interested in: 

— the number of astronomy/astrophysics PhDs awarded per year, over the last 10-20 years; 
— the number of (tenure-track) faculty positions available per year, over the last 10-20 years; 
— the number of staff scientist positions available per year, over the last 10-20 years; 
— the mean and median salaries of astronomy/astrophysics PhDs, staff scientists and (tenure-track) 
     faculty (over the last 10-20 years if possible). 
— the mean and median age at the awarding of an astronomy/astrophysics PhD. 
— the mean and median age when made a permanent faculty member. 

I would massively appreciate it if you could point me towards the resources that might have
this information available. 

Many thanks in advance. 

Yours, 
Nic
